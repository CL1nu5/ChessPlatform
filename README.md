# ChessObjects.Chess Projekt &nbsp; [![Unit Tests](https://github.com/CL1nu5/ChessPlatform/actions/workflows/automatedUnitTests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/CL1nu5/ChessPlatform/actions/workflows/automatedUnitTests.yml)
<hr>
This is a little chess projekt I work on myself. 
In the future it should include everything needed to play a game of chess local against your friends. 
In the future I may add a chess-bot to play against, or even an online mode.

## How to play it?
- To play it just execute the following java file:
[mainClient.java](src/main/java/Main/MainClient.java) 
 - To play with friends on different computers one of you needs to execute following java file:
[mainServer.java](src/main/java/Main/MainServer.java)
   - after starting the server both players have to connect to it, one remote via ip address the other selects localhost
   - To connect, both pc's you have to be in the same network

## Overview
This is how the game looks like:
